# ESOFT Lab Classes Support - Public

This project has the design and code contents for ESOFT's Lab classes.

It is maintained by ISEP's LEI/ESOFT teachers.

The whole project is split on packages:

* package pt.ipp.isep.dei.esoft.project - the project
    * .lab.one - inside the project package, there is a lab.one, two, three, etc. for each lab class
        * .problem.one - inside each lab class, there is one or more problems
            * .version.one - inside each problem there is a version package for different versions of each problem.

Students should implement the code for each //TODO according to the instructions in the lab class slides.

Classes without Solution in the name, are the ones that students should implement.

# How to run the project
This project used Java and Maven.

We have to declare the maven-surefire-plugin in the pom.xml file and configure the dependencies of this plugin. 

We have to declare the following dependencies:

The junit-platform-surefire-provider dependency allows us to run tests that use either the “old” JUnit (3 or 4) or JUnit 5.

If we want to run tests that use JUnit 5, we have to declare the junit-jupiter-engine dependency.

## Maven goals
### Run the unit tests
```
mvn clean test
```

### Generate javadoc for the source code
```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

### Generate javadoc for the test code
```
mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
```

### Generate Jacoco source code coverage report
```
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Check if thresholds limits are achieved
```
mvn test jacoco:check
```

### Generates a PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```

### Generates a quicker PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DwithHistory
```

### Complete example

``` 
mvn test jacoco:report org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DhistoryInputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -DhistoryOutputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -Dsonar.pitest.mode=reuseReport -Dthreads=4 -DtimestampedReports=false
```
## Jacoco dependencies
* https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
  - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
    - required to work with JUnit5
